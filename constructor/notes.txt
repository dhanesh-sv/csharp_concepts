Constructors:

1)It is a special method(name same as classname) in a class responsible for initializing variables of that class.
2)It does not return a value.
3)To create an instance of the class we need constructors that are acccessible.
4)The compiler defines an implicit constructor and initializes the variables with default values if we did not define the constructor.
5)Implicitly defined constructors are parameterless and also called as Default constructors.
6)Implicit constructors are only public.
